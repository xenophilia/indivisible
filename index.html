== Why do people hate? ==

...We hate reflexively so, to fight hatred, we must retrain our reflexes.
As newborns, we have no basis for hatred.
As infants, we learn to imitate our parents.
We are read stories which become second nature.
We memorize folk-tales, fairy-tales, and idioms to become socialized.
We read books and learn behaviors in school.
Teachers want you to see through their eyes.
Fellow students want you to join and justify group behavior.

...By the time we get to high school, or further
our reflex responses to people who are different
have been established to such a degree that
convincing ones self of prejudice,
let alone convincing other people of theirs
is not likely to be subject to effective retraining
by reason alone.

...Xenophilia is love for difference.
Our country is great, and has always been,
due to the unfettered acceptance of
differences of all kinds.
Restrictions on this fertility of ideas and cultures
is contrary to the ideas enshrined in
our most precious founding documents.

...As !url Franklin Delano Roosevelt @http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5057/ url!
said, "The Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself - nameless, unreasoning,
unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to
convert retreat into advance.".

...So, let your curiosity overcome your fears.
Retrain your reflexes right down to the most primitive infant/childhood level.
Open yourself to discovery of whatever monsters you may harbor.
Then, resolutely, fight those monsters
with all the moral convictions you have.

...This volatile time is the perfect time to unify
with other people having other monsters.
Together, we can fight the larger monsters of our day.

==== Roots of reflex prejudice ====

...&xeno; believes that diversity training, the application of reason to
resolve conflict, fails to address the roots of prejudice. Most prejudice
begins with children observing and imitating their care providers. Their
instant situation responses depend on reactions which kept them safe and
encouraged when they were young. Once children begin their education they are
challenged with ideas and reason, forcing them to try new reactions. Often,
this two step process is not mastered or is bypassed during times of high
stress. In our diverse communities good people are conflicted between
cultural/familial training and national unity around equality. Great
inspirational speeches have offered hope but few actionable paths.

==== Retraining reflex prejudice ====

...&xeno; proposes a strategic initiative for prejudice-based conflict
resolution. From existing studies we infer opportunities to measure and
recondition reflex prejudice. We envision diplomatic opportunities between
police and minority communities where mistrust has been in the news lately. We
offer to lead, participate in, or advise a group tasked with testing whether
this proposal has merit.

==== Precedent for reflex training ====

...&xeno; believe that reflexes can be retrained, reducing the likelihood
of mistakes when rapid decisions are required. There have been studies
conducted throughout the 20th century identifying intrinsic and trained
stimulus/response pairs in both humans and animals. Pavlov's experiments were
extensive. The Stanford prison experiment showed what happens when you divide
people and giving more power to one group. Another experiment (Richardson,
Alan, Mental Imagery, New York: Springer Publishing Company, Inc., 1969) showed
the power of even simple reflex retraining. Much can be achieved by retraining
reflexes that cannot be achieved by reason or diversity training. Bad choices
are not just due to education, emotion, philosophy, or culture. They are more
driven by habitual unintended unreasoned reflex prejudice.

==== Reflex retraining methodology ====

...&xeno; has done preliminary experiments with a novel game-like
environment. The scoring system detects stimulated reflex prejudice, rewarding
its reduction with higher scores. It bypasses decision-making based on reason
and aims to change people at a more fundamental level, while
tracking/documenting reflex enrichment as they adapt and evolve. We see such
audit documentation as a means to communicate improvements in responses to
observers in a served community (such as providing community leaders and the
police with mutual oversight opportunities). When police score better in the
proposed games they have either successfully adapted and adopted the new and
less prejudiced reflexes or they are gaming the system, yet still have less
entrenched reflexes. We firmly believe that most police are good people who
would be happy to improve these reflexes. We also believe that most citizens
are good people seeking a more peaceful community. A "best" use of the
technology would be reciprocal, with the community also documenting reduced
prejudice towards police.

==== Strategic initiative ====

...&xeno; is ready to lead or advise on the development and deployment of
games/tests which enable organizations to train and document trends of
decreasing unintended reflex prejudice. Audit documents could be used to
support discussions between conflicted communities. We speculate that making
such reflex retraining mandatory on both sides of a conflict can have broad
impact; possibly making America a new leader in conflict resolution. From a
layperson's point of view, We do not see any legal impediment to such an
initiative.

...!url !=indivisible=! @https://www.indivisibleguide.com/ url!
is a national group calling on Americans to rediscover unity.
This website is designed as an invitation for people
as local as Worcester, MA to form a local indivisible group.
If we are successful with our ideas,
we hope to have national impact.

    == Xenophilia ==
...Xenophily or xenophilia means an affection for
unknown/foreign objects or people.
It is the opposite of xenophobia or xenophoby.
